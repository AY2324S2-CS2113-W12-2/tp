## Product scope
### Target user profile

Our target user profile primarily consists of NUS university students, including fitness enthusiasts, 
athletes adhering to strict dietary regimens, and individuals aiming to adopt a healthier lifestyle. 
These students are often juggling academic commitments, extracurricular activities, and social obligations, 
leaving little time for comprehensive meal planning and exercise routines. They recognize the importance 
of maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity to support their overall well-being,
but struggle to find the time and resources to effectively manage their fitness goals. By providing a 
convenient solution for tracking calorie intake and exercise routines tailored to their individual height 
and weight, our application aims to empower these busy students to make informed decisions about their 
nutrition and fitness. Through personalized guidance and easy-to-use features, we strive to assist them 
in achieving their fitness objectives while navigating the challenges of university life.

### Value proposition

University students, overwhelmed by academic pressures, often find it challenging to balance exercise and nutrition. 
A dedicated chatbot can ease their burden, providing daily guidance on workouts and diet. 
By simplifying these decisions, the chatbot helps students stay fit amidst their demanding 
schedules, fostering a healthier lifestyle.
