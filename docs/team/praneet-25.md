**Enhancements implemented:** I took charge of implementing the calorie tracker feature and included the calorie deficit and surplus
feature so that users can get a good gauge if their exercise burnt down the calories of their meal intake or not.

**Contributions to the UG:** I included the testing data for the food items and exercises. In addition, I made contributions to 
the command summary list.

**Contributions to the DG:** I was in charge of crafting the sequence diagrams for the storage and parser package
and amended the command summary. The diagrams provide insight the interactions within the system, ensuring the users
can better understand the software development process.
