### Summary of Contributions
**Code contributed:** https://shorturl.at/msvFP

**Enhancements implemented:** I spearheaded the implementation of critical enhancements, including the goal-setting and
find features, along with the functionality for users to add new exercises and the clear function in order to clear all 
the data and start application from begin. Moreover, I implemented the change water goal command in order for users 
to change their water goal for the day. These enhancements significantly improved the functionality and usability of 
our application.

**Contributions to the UG:** My contributions to the User Guide were substantial. I authored the sections outlining the
basic features of our program and played a key role in refining the user guide format to ensure clarity and 
completeness and also implemented the FAQs. My team members built upon the basic structure of the UG I have created 
initially.

**Contributions to the DG:** I took the lead in creating comprehensive sequence diagrams for both the main component 
and UI package, amended the target user profile and filled up the part on how a user can do manual testing easily.
These diagrams provided invaluable insights into system interactions, facilitating better understanding and 
development.

**Contributions to team-based tasks:** Within our team, I took on the responsibility of ensuring equitable distribution
of work among team members, ensuring that each member had an appropriate workload to maintain balance and productivity.
We split the work equally, and I actively monitored progress to address any discrepancies. Whenever help was needed, I 
provided support and guidance to my teammates, offering assistance and sharing knowledge to empower them in carrying
out their tasks effectively. This collaborative approach fostered a supportive team environment and facilitated smooth 
project execution. Moreover, I was proactive in fixing bugs whenever someone found a bug in our application and made 
sure I reported bugs proactively when I find one as well.

**Review/mentoring contributions:**  I effectively delegated tasks, ensured alignment, and conducted thorough reviews 
of team members' work. I provided extensive feedback and guidance on Pull Requests (PRs), ensuring adherence to 
standards and fostering continuous improvement. Additionally, I ensured that the 3 tests passed in GitHub before 
approving PRs and made sure respective issues were solved with the code.

**Contributions beyond the project team:** Beyond our project, I actively engaged with the broader community by sharing 
insights and offering support on the forum. I reported bugs and provided assistance in resolving issues in other team's 
products, showcasing my helping tendency and commitment to collaboration.

My leadership, dedication, and technical expertise have been instrumental in the success of our project. I believe my 
contributions warrant a favorable evaluation and recognition for my efforts.
