## Quick Start

To get started quickly with ActiveEdge,
follow these simple steps:

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `ActiveEdge` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W12-2/tp/releases). 
3. Copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ActiveEdge.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the home folder you put the jar file in, and run the following command: java -jar ActiveEdge.jar. You should see a welcome screen.
5. Type commands beside >>> and press Enter to execute it.
(e.g. typing ```help``` and pressing Enter will show the help page).
## Design & implementation üèπ  
### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/SuveenE/tp/blob/master/images/System-Architecture.png?raw=true)

The Architecture Diagram above shows a high-level overview of the architectural design of ActiveEdge.

Active Edge is comprised of 8 major components:

```Main```: The entry point of the application.\
```UI```: A package responsible for handling user interactions, both capturing input and displaying output.\
```Parser```: A package that analyzes and interprets the user's input commands.\
```Command```: A package tasked with executing specific actions based on the user's commands.\
```Storage```: A package focused on persisting and retrieving all relevant data from the application's local storage system, ensuring data continuity and integrity.\
```LogList```: Maintains logged data throughout the application's runtime.\
```FoodData```: Active Edge's food database\
```ExerciseData```: Active Edge's exercise database\
### Generic Sequence Diagram
The generic sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the interactions between various components within the
ActiveEdge application. It illustrates how user commands are parsed, executed, and interact with different modules such
as user interface, data storage, and task management.

![Generic Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W12-2/tp/blob/master/images/GenericSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

### Parser
The Parser components can be found within the Parser package.
It is responsible for parsing the input String of the user, and returning an appropriate XYZCommand class.
If the input is invalid, it throws exceptions to the Error package for error handling.
The Parser Class Diagram below shows how Execute, Parser, Error, Command classes of their respective packages work together.

![Parser](https://github.com/SuveenE/tp/blob/master/images/Parser.png?raw=true)

### Command

In the provided code, commands are represented as individual classes, each encapsulating a specific action or operation 
within the ActiveEdge application, promoting modularity and separation of concerns. The graph below depicts the 
interactions between the different components of  ActiveEdge  when water, a meal or an exercise is logged in.

![Command](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W12-2/tp/blob/master/images/LogCommand.png?raw=true)

### Storage
Storage is the main class responsible for file operations and data management.
UserDetailsList, LogHeight, and LogWeight handle user details such as height and weight logs.
TaskList manages various types of tasks including goals, meals, water intake, and exercises.
GoalTask, MealTask, WaterTask, and ExerciseTask are specific task types with their attributes.
AddBMICommand, AddHeightCommand, and AddWeightCommand are commands for adding BMI, height, and weight respectively.
The relationships depicted in the diagram are primarily composition and inheritance:


![Storage](https://github.com/SuveenE/tp/blob/master/images/Storage.png?raw=true)

Storage has composition relationships with UserDetailsList and TaskList as it manages instances of these classes.
UserDetailsList and TaskList have a composition relationship with their respective contained classes (LogHeight, LogWeight, GoalTask, MealTask, WaterTask, ExerciseTask) 
as they hold lists of instances of these classes. AddBMICommand, AddHeightCommand, and AddWeightCommand are standalone commands 
used within the Storage class but don't directly interact with the other classes in the diagram.

### Main Component
The ActiveEdge class serves as the main entry point for the ActiveEdge application, handling user input parsing and interaction through a command-line interface.
![Main Component](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W12-2/tp/blob/master/images/Main-component2%20UML.png?raw=true)


### UI Package
The activeedge.ui package encapsulates the user interface components of the ActiveEdge application, facilitating interactions such as printing welcome messages, 
logging meal and exercise data, displaying goal information, providing help instructions, and managing user queries and commands for health tracking and goal setting.
![Ui Package](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W12-2/tp/blob/master/images/Ui.png?raw=true)

Under commands, there are 17 sub-components:
```AddBMICommand```: A command responsible for calculating and adding Body Mass Index (BMI) information.
```AddGoalsCommand```: A command responsible for users to set and track their fitness goals.
```AddHeightCommand```: A command responsible for users to input and track their height information for comprehensive health tracking.
```AddWeightCommand```: A command responsible for users to input and track their weight measurements to monitor their progress and achievements.
```ClearCommand```: A command responsible for users to clear or delete entries, such as meals, from their tracking history.
```DeleteTaskCommand```: A command responsible for users to delete or remove exercise tasks.
```FindCommand```: A command responsible for users to search specific keywords.
```ShowSummaryCommand```: A command responsible for users to view a summary or overview of their calorie intake,calorie burnt during exercise .
```ViewWaterIntakeCommand```: A command responsible for users to view and track their water intake levels.

### Task Package
This package is structured to manage and represent various types of tasks within an application, potentially for goal tracking, 
exercise logging, meal recording, and water intake monitoring. There are 3 main components of this package.
![Ui](https://github.com/SuveenE/tp/blob/master/images/Task_package.png?raw=true)

**Base class:`Task`**
+ **Purpose**: Serves as the foundational class for all types of tasks. It encapsulates the common
attribute all tasks share, which is a description
+ **Attributes**: `description`: A `String` that provides a brief description of the task.
+ **Methods**: 
  + `getDescription()`
  + `toString()`

**Derived class:`GoalTask`**
+ **Attributes**: Stores information about goals
+ **Functionality**: Allows users to log their goals

**Derived class:`LogExercise`**
+ **Attributes**: Stores information about exercises, such as the name of food, duration, and calories burnt 
+ **Functionality**: Allows users to log their exercsies

**Derived class:`MealTask`**
+ **Attributes**: Stores information about meals, such as the name of food, number of servings, and calories
+ **Functionality**: Allows users to log their meals 

**Derived class:`WaterTask`**
+ **Attributes**: Stores information about water intake, such as the amount of water
+ **Functionality**: Allows users to log their water intake

**Utility class:`TaskList`**
+ **Purpose**: Manages a collection of `Task` objects (including all derived types).
+ **Attributes**: `tasksList`: A static ArrayList that stores instances of `Task` and its subclasses.
+ **Methods**:
  + `add(Task task)`
  + `delete(int index)`
  + `get()`
  + `clearTasks()`
