to take a look at the code I contributed

**Enhancements implemented:** 
1. Implemented `ExerciseData` and `FoodData` class to store information about the food and exercises
2. Implemented `ShowSummaryCommand` class to calculate the calorie status of user and the meal, water intake and exercises
logged in the by user
3. Wrote test codes for `exerciseDataTest`, `foodDataTest`  and `ChangeCalorieGoalCommandTest`
4. Made changes to the `parser` to facilitate the logging of exercises and meals without any errors

**Contributions to the UG:** I included the testing data for the food items and exercises. In addition, I made 
contributions to the command summary list. I also added screenshots for some of the expected outputs of some features 
such as logging water intake, logging exercises and etc.

**Contributions to the DG:** I was in charge of crafting the sequence diagrams for the storage and parser package
and amended the command summary. The diagrams provide insight the interactions within the system, ensuring the users
can better understand the software development process. In addition, I wrote the instructions of how to use the 
developer guide and the non-functional requirements.

**Contributions to team-based tasks:** We divided the workload equally, and I closely monitored progress to address any 
imbalances.Additionally, I took a proactive role in addressing bugs in our application and promptly reported any 
issues I discovered.

**Review/mentoring contributions:** I played a key role in reviewing and mentoring team members by delegating tasks 
effectively, providing detailed feedback on Pull Requests, and ensuring code quality through rigorous testing.

**Contributions beyond the project team:** Beyond our project team, I actively engaged with the community by sharing
insights and assisting on forums. I also contributed to other teams' projects by reporting bugs and offering help, 
demonstrating my collaborative nature and dedication to supporting others.
